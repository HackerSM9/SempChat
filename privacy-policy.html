        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>SempChat does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All chat sessions and authentication information (username and PIN) are only held temporarily during each active chat session and are deleted automatically after the session ends.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>We only use your username and PIN to authenticate and create a secure connection between you and your selected chat partner. No data is retained after the session ends.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We use secure HTTPS protocols to encrypt data transmitted between users, protecting your connection from unauthorized access. Additionally, SempChat does not save or retain any user data, chat messages, or PINs.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>SempChat does not use any third-party tracking or analytic services. We also do not display ads or include links to external sites.</p>
